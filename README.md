- To do:

  - Move stateful logic to App.js! Really, make sure props aren't getting changed in-module.

  - Give an indication that they're hiding and that you may have to resize the window.

  - Should have idle thoughts too that have nothing to do with needs. Happy thoughts, even. Not just the "babe" one.

  - React to items specifically, with awareness of whether that's what they wanted.

  - When you use an item during a video transition, we seem to get stuck with no visible videos.
    - Animation-in-progress variable?
  - Maybe give a thought to balancing

  - At least one more video, for megasad and maybe for "hey thanks, but that wasn't what I needed"

  - Vital bars

    - Labels, maybe cute icons.

    - They should react when you add more to a full bar.

    - They should be less ugly.

    - New item animation is applying to the last item in the box instead of the newest one!
