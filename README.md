# Mata

- To do:

  - PropType it up.

  - Give an indication that they're hiding and that you may have to resize the window.

  - Should have idle thoughts too that have nothing to do with needs. Happy thoughts, even. Not just the "babe" one.

  - React to items specifically, with awareness of whether that's what they wanted.

  - When you use an item during a video transition, we seem to get stuck with no visible videos.
    - Animation-in-progress variable?
  - Maybe give a thought to balancing? Game play? Not really my strong suit.

  - At least one more video, for mega-sad and maybe for "hey thanks, but that wasn't what I needed"

  - Vital bars

    - They should be less ugly.
  
  - Something should actually happen when the vitals all go to zero! I don't want Mata to "die", maybe they get reincarnated? With a randomized message of what they ended up as? "Mata was reincarnated as a pop tart! Click here to restart." 

  - Check out the Time Alive, something went weird just now. Said 3 days instead of like, 6 hours.

  - If you're gonna keep the text, at least make it sit well.
