## Notes

Oh hey, all those old notes were things that are finished and working well now!

## To do:

+ thoughtBubble
    - Hide thought bubble when Mata is hiding.

    - Give an indication that he is hiding and that you may have to resize the window.

    - Should have idle thoughts too that have nothing to do with needs. Happy thoughts, even.

+ Timer for how many days he's kept alive/dead

+ COOKIES
    
    - inventory
    - activeInventory
    - vitals (update how often?)
    - last visited
    - first visited (for alive time)
    - total time spent?

+ Visuals
    - Better icons, the coo one is creepy and the tofu one is dumb.
    - Get text to align well in cloud
        + is custom textbox shapes a thing in HTML5?
    - Items border should match button borders, who winns?

+ Do I like current vital decays?
    - Some actions should speed it up or slow it down
        + maybe.
