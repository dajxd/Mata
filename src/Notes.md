## Notes

Oh hey, all those old notes were things that are finished and working well now!

## To do:

- thoughtBubble

  - Give an indication that they're hiding and that you may have to resize the window.

  - Should have idle thoughts too that have nothing to do with needs. Happy thoughts, even.

  - React to items specifically, with awareness of whether that's what they wanted. They pronouns!
